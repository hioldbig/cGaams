Some ancient C language (Turbo C mainly) codes, born in my undergraduate years. I put them in a repository only for keeping them, or, you might say, to commemorate the years when I was learning C language. 

These source codes almost can not run under the operating systems (WIN/LINUX) nowadays. If you can properly install turbo C enviroment on your computer, you may make it run. Or you can adjust them to suit the current C language environment before making them executable.
